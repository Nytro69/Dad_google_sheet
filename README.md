To use the script you need to first prepare a Folder with your pictures, it should look like this: Root -> product_name -> online -> product_name.jpg, notice if you have multible images in the online folder it will only take the first image.

In the picture is products the root folder and the numbers represent the product_name. Note: The root folder needs to be shared to everyone who has the link. It's likely that your work-drive won't work so you can add the folder to your private drive.
